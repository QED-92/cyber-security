## Overview

**Authentication** is the process of verifying an entity’s identity, ensuring that a user is who they claim to be. Authorization, on the other hand, determines what an authenticated entity is allowed to access or perform within a system.

Authentication serves as the **first line of defense** against unauthorized access in web applications. The most common authentication mechanism is the **login form**, where users provide a username and password to prove their identity.

Authentication mechanisms are commonly categorized into three major types:

- Knowledge-based authentication
- Ownership-based authentication
- Inherence-based authentication

**Knowledge-based authentication** relies on **something the user knows** in order to prove their identity. Common examples include:

- Passwords
- Passphrases
- PINs
- Answers to security questions

This is the most widely used authentication method and is often the primary target for attacks such as brute-force, credential stuffing, and password reuse.

**Ownership-based authentication** relies on **something the user possesses**. This can include:

- Physical objects (e.g., ID cards, hardware tokens)
- Software-based tokens (e.g., TOTP codes generated by authentication apps)

This method is commonly used as an additional security layer in multi-factor authentication schemes.

**Inherence-based authentication** relies on **something the user is or does**. This category includes biometric identifiers such as:

- Fingerprints
- Facial recognition
- Voice recognition
- Behavioral patterns (e.g., typing dynamics)

While often more difficult to bypass, biometric systems introduce unique security and privacy considerations.

**Single-factor authentication** relies on **only one authentication factor**, most commonly a password. Applications using SFA are particularly susceptible to authentication-based attacks if additional protections are not implemented.

**Multi-factor authentication** requires **two or more distinct authentication factors**, such as:

- Something the user knows (password)
- Something the user has (security token)
- Something the user is (biometric data)

MFA significantly increases security by reducing the impact of compromised credentials.
