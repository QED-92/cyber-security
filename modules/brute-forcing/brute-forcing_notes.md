# Login Brute Forcing

---

## Overview

Brute forcing is a trial-and-error method commonly used to crack passwords, hashes and encryption keys. The process can be likened to a thief trying every key on a giant key-ring until they find one that unlocks the vault. 

The success of a brute force attack depends on three main components:

- Password complexity
- Computational power
- Security measures

A longer and more complex password obviously require more time and computational resources to crack. The following guidelines should be followed when creating passwords:

| Attribute        | Guideline                                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Length`         | `Minimum of 12 characters.`                                 |
| `Complexity`     | `Combination of lowercase, uppercase, numbers and symbols.` |
| `Uniqueness`     | `A unique password for each service (no reuse).`            |
| `Randomness`     | `As much randomness as possible.`                           |
